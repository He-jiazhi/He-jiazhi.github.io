My name is Jiazhi He, I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.pitt.edu/) of [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/). Prior to joining University of Pittsburgh, I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from [The School of Mathematical Science](https://math.ustc.edu.cn/ENGLISH/list.htm) of [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in July 2023.

I have broad research interests in methodology and theory in high-dimensional statistical inference, nonparametric density estimation and statistical machine learning, to establish reliable, powerful, and interpretable solutions to wide real-world problems.
