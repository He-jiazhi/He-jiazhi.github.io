- [Wenbin Zhou @ CMU](https://wbzhou2001.github.io/) is my roommate at USTC. He is a handsome boy and many girls like him.

- [Yuxuan Zong @ USTC](http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~zyx240014/) is a great probability student. I have to mention that he is really responsible as a teaching assistant, with many elegant $$ \LaTeX $$ recitation notes. He is so good at board games that we all dream to win him once :(.
