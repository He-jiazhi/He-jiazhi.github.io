- [Wenbin Zhou @ CMU](https://wbzhou2001.github.io/) is my roommate at USTC. He is a very handsome and competitive man.

- [Yuxuan Zong @ USTC](http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~zyx240014/) is a great probability student. I have to mention that he is really responsible as a teaching assistant, with many elegant $$ \LaTeX $$ recitation notes. He is so good at board games that we all dream to win him once :(.

- [Yian Wang (CanYing) @ UCI](https://canying.me/) is not only an awesome master student in Computer Engineering but also a quality man in various aspects of life (e.g. food, playing good games, master in credit card and flight tickets).  BTW, I really enjoy playing PUBG with him :).
